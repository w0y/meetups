### Intro to

# Attack/Defense CTFs

A young Hacker's illustrated primer

name: ctf

# Capture The Flag

## Jeopardy

+ tasks need to be solved for flags/points
+ categories like Web, Forensic, Crypto, Stego, ...
+ teams compete for more points = higher rank on scoreboard
+ duration: 24-72h

---
template: ctf

## Attack/Defense

+ teams play against each other
+ *every* team gets a server with (the same) vulnerable services (Vulnbox)
+ all teams are connected via game network (VPN)
+ goal 1: pwn foreign services => **attack points**
+ goal 2: secure own services => **defense points**
+ goal 3: keep own services up/functional => **SLA points**
+ duration: 8/9h usually

# Attack/Defense CTF

### Flag: text string

```
Regex:  FAUST_[A-Za-z0-9/\+]{32}
e.g.    FAUST_WShfxBYH7MadRQAAAACqQSJyXseHHZvj
```

### What's a service?

Some program with vulnerabilities, specifically written for the contest.
+ Python, C, C++, C#, Java, sometimes exotic stuff (hello, COBOL)
+ stores and allows to retrieve flags in some way
+ usually accessible via web interface or just TCP socket

---
name: ctf

# Attack/Defense CTF

### Gameserver

+ provided by the organizers
+ periodically stores flags in every service on every Vulnbox
+ later retrieves flags => checks if each service is working correctly
+ allows teams to submit stolen flags for points
+ runs the scoring, provides a scoreboard

---
template: ctf
name: ctf

### Rules

Depend on the CTF organizers, but usually:
+ no attacks against game infrastructure
+ no denial-of-service attacks against networks or machines
+ (no attacks against other player's machines)
+ (connections may not be filtered, i.e. actual bugs should be fixed)
+ (be fair, be friendly, etc.)

# Attack/Defense CTF

### Game phases

1. before start: every team downloads encrypted VM image
1. start: organizers provide decryption password<br>
   => explore services, processes, configuration (reconnaissance)<br>
   => secure machine, add SSH keys, ...
1. 1h later: network between teams and gameserver goes up<br>
   => attacks incoming
1. 8hrs later: game ends
1. party

# Shall we play a game?

+ step 1: plug in, mount share, don't panic

---
template: useful
name: useful

+ choose a service
    + find other people working on that (dashboard)
    + see what it does (poke it with a stick)
    + read source *(if available)*, reverse engineer
    + look at stored data & network traffic

---
template: useful
name: useful

+ identify exploitable issues (SQLi, command injection, etc.)
    + **Attack**
        + test exploit manually: submit flag in dashboard
        + if it works: yay, time for automation!
            + write an exploit script (we have *templates*)
            + submit in dashboard
            + watch stats for success!
    + **Defend**
        + patch own service (make a backup)
        + see if the service stays functional

+ eat pizza, make a meme, repeat

# Our infrastructure: w0y.at

## GitLab

https://gitlab.w0y.at

+ one git repo per contest
+ check in service files, exploit scripts, etc.

## Mattermost

https://mattermost.w0y.at

+ one team per contest, one channel per service
+ **Town Square:** important messages for all players
+ **Off-Topic:** totally spam
+ **MOC:** meme operation center (the funny spam)

# W0PR components

**Web Dashboard**<br>
overview, alerts, stats, everything

**Exploit Execut0r**<br>
periodically runs exploit scripts against other teams' Vulnboxes

**Flagbot**<br>
submits gathered flags to Gameserver

**Scoreboard scraper**<br>
scrapes organizers' scoreboard, writes points into our DB

**Traffic monitoring**<br>
dump vulnbox traffic in 5-min intervals onto share

***netana***<br>
scary intelligent network dump analyzer

# Our network setup: hostnames

* service.i [s.i] - service VM
* dashboard.i - web dashboard

### Our Vulnbox - the crown jewel: **vuln.i** [**v.i**]

```sh
ssh ctf@v.i
ssh root@v.i  # be careful
```

---
template: hostnames

### Enemy Vulnboxes: **team**ID**.attack**

```sh
nc team37.attack 8080
```

Be careful what you reveal, other teams will monitor their traffic too!

FAUST CTF: use **NOP team** (ID: 1) for testing.

# Preparing is caring

### Stages of enlightenment

+ get a GitLab/Mattermost account
+ add your SSH key in GitLab (**important**)
+ setup your pwning environment (pwntools, Wireshark, ...)
+ check out exploit script templates
+ ...

### Bring with you

+ Notebook, monitor, *[device]*
+ Ethernet cable
+ Power strip
+ (Gigabit switch)
